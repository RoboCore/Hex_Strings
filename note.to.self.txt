Note to self - 1:						(26/02/13)
	when using USE_POINTER_LIST, the address of __heap_start
	is added to __freelist, showing then more memory than
	there is
	# by commenting the call to FreeByteArray() in ResizeByteArray()
		this issue doesn't happen anymore; however more
		memory is allocated during program execution. This
		issue still occurs when the lines of code of
		FreeByteArray() are copied to replace its call;
	# when using debug to check which addresses were freed
		in FreeByteArray(), the address of __heap_start
		was NEVER displayed;
	# to see where it first occurs, uncomment the lines where
		(### note to self - 1 ###) are foun in the sketch
		example, and add the following lines to
		<Memory.h>::freeListSize()
			Serial.print("+++++ ");
			Serial.print((int)current, HEX);
			Serial.print(" .. ");
			Serial.println((int)current->sz);
